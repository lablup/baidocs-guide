# Admonitions

Admonitions are special callout boxes that help you highlight important information, warnings, tips, and notes in your documentation. BaiDocs provides a rich set of built-in admonition types with customizable styling.

## Basic Admonitions

### Note

Use notes for general information and helpful context:

```mdx
:::note
This is a note admonition. Use it to provide additional context or helpful information that doesn't require immediate action.
:::

:::note Custom Title
You can also provide a custom title for your note.
:::
```

**Result:**

:::note
This is a note admonition. Use it to provide additional context or helpful information that doesn't require immediate action.
:::

### Tip

Use tips for helpful suggestions and best practices:

```mdx
:::tip
Here's a helpful tip for improving your documentation workflow!
:::

:::tip Pro Tip
Always test your documentation with real users to ensure clarity and completeness.
:::
```

**Result:**

:::tip

:::

### Warning

Use warnings to highlight potential issues or important considerations:

```mdx
:::warning
Be careful when modifying production configurations. Always backup your data first.
:::

:::warning Important
This action cannot be undone. Make sure you understand the consequences before proceeding.
:::
```

**Result:**

:::warning
Be careful when modifying production configurations. Always backup your data first.
:::

### Danger

Use danger for critical warnings that could cause data loss or system issues:

```mdx
:::danger
Running this command will permanently delete all data. This action cannot be reversed.
:::

:::danger Critical Security Warning
Never expose your API keys in public repositories or client-side code.
:::
```

**Result:**

:::danger
Running this command will permanently delete all data. This action cannot be reversed.
:::

### Info

Use info for neutral informational content:

```mdx
:::info
The maintenance window is scheduled for Sunday, 2:00 AM - 4:00 AM UTC.
:::

:::info System Requirements
- Node.js 18.0 or higher
- Git 2.0 or higher
- 4GB RAM minimum
:::
```

**Result:**

:::info
The maintenance window is scheduled for Sunday, 2:00 AM - 4:00 AM UTC.
:::

### Success

Use success to highlight positive outcomes or completed actions:

```mdx
:::success
Configuration updated successfully! Your changes are now active.
:::

:::success Setup Complete
Your BaiDocs installation is ready. You can now start creating documentation.
:::
```

**Result:**

:::success
Configuration updated successfully! Your changes are now active.

## Advanced Admonition Features

### Nested Content

Admonitions can contain complex content including lists, code blocks, and other Markdown elements:

```mdx
:::warning Prerequisites Check
Before proceeding with the installation, ensure you have:

1. **Node.js 18+** installed on your system
2. **Git** configured with your credentials
3. **Write permissions** for the target directory

```bash
# Verify your setup
node --version  # Should be 18.0 or higher
git --version   # Should be 2.0 or higher
```

If any of these requirements are not met, please refer to the [installation guide](../getting-started/installation.mdx).

### Collapsible Admonitions

Create collapsible admonitions for detailed information:

```mdx
:::details Click to expand detailed explanation
This content is hidden by default and only shows when the user clicks to expand it.

This is useful for:
- Detailed technical explanations
- Optional advanced configurations
- Troubleshooting steps
- Additional examples

```javascript
// Example code that might be too detailed for the main flow
const advancedConfig = {
  cache: {
    enabled: true,
    ttl: 3600,
    strategy: 'LRU'
  },
  compression: {
    algorithm: 'gzip',
    level: 6
  }
};
```
:::
```

**Result:**

:::details Click to expand detailed explanation
This content is hidden by default and only shows when the user clicks to expand it.

This is useful for:
- Detailed technical explanations
- Optional advanced configurations
- Troubleshooting steps
- Additional examples

```javascript
// Example code that might be too detailed for the main flow
const advancedConfig = {
  cache: {
    enabled: true,
    ttl: 3600,
    strategy: 'LRU'
  },
  compression: {
    algorithm: 'gzip',
    level: 6
  }
};
```

## Custom Admonition Types

### Creating Custom Types

You can create custom admonition types for specific use cases:

```mdx
:::api API Reference
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/users`

**Parameters:**
- `limit` (optional): Maximum number of users to return (default: 10)
- `offset` (optional): Number of users to skip (default: 0)

**Response:**
```json
{
  "users": [...],
  "total": 150,
  "limit": 10,
  "offset": 0
}
```
:::

:::example Code Example
Here's how to implement user authentication:

```javascript
import { authenticateUser } from './auth';

async function loginUser(email, password) {
  try {
    const user = await authenticateUser(email, password);
    return { success: true, user };
  } catch (error) {
    return { success: false, error: error.message };
  }
}
```
:::
```

### Themed Admonitions

Create admonitions that match your brand or specific themes:

```mdx
:::theme-primary Brand Message
This admonition uses your primary brand colors and styling.
:::

:::theme-secondary Additional Information
This uses secondary brand colors for less prominent information.
:::

:::theme-accent Highlighted Content
Use accent colors for content that needs special attention.
:::
```

## Best Practices

### When to Use Each Type

| Type | Use Case | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Note** | General information, context | "Note that this feature requires authentication" |
| **Tip** | Best practices, suggestions | "Tip: Use descriptive commit messages" |
| **Info** | Neutral information | "The API rate limit is 1000 requests/hour" |
| **Warning** | Potential issues | "Warning: This will overwrite existing files" |
| **Danger** | Critical warnings | "Danger: This action permanently deletes data" |
| **Success** | Positive outcomes | "Success: Installation completed" |

### Content Guidelines

**Be Concise**:
```mdx
<!-- Good -->
:::warning
Backup your data before proceeding.
:::

<!-- Avoid -->
:::warning
It is highly recommended that you should consider creating a backup of all your important data files before you continue with this process because there might be a chance that something could go wrong.
:::
```

**Use Active Voice**:
```mdx
<!-- Good -->
:::tip
Run tests before deploying to production.
:::

<!-- Avoid -->
:::tip
Tests should be run before deployment to production is done.
:::
```

**Provide Context**:
```mdx
<!-- Good -->
:::warning File Permissions
Ensure the web server has write permissions to the uploads directory. On Unix systems, use `chmod 755 uploads/`.
:::

<!-- Avoid -->
:::warning
Check permissions.
:::
```

### Visual Hierarchy

```

### Color Schemes

Admonitions automatically adapt to your theme, but you can customize colors:

```css
/* Custom admonition styling */
.admonition-note {
  --admonition-color: #1976d2;
}

.admonition-success {
  --admonition-color: #388e3c;
}

.admonition-warning {
  --admonition-color: #f57c00;
}

.admonition-danger {
  --admonition-color: #d32f2f;
}
```

## Accessibility

### Screen Reader Support

Admonitions are designed with accessibility in mind:

```mdx
:::warning Screen Reader Support
This warning will be announced to screen readers with appropriate ARIA labels and roles.
:::
```

### Keyboard Navigation

Users can navigate through admonitions using keyboard:
- **Tab**: Move to next interactive element
- **Enter/Space**: Expand/collapse details admonitions
- **Escape**: Close expanded details

### Color Contrast

All admonition types meet WCAG 2.1 AA color contrast requirements:
- Text contrast ratio: 4.5:1 minimum
- Icon contrast ratio: 3:1 minimum
- Focus indicators: High contrast borders

## Advanced Examples

### Multi-step Processes

Break complex processes into clear steps with appropriate admonitions:

```mdx
